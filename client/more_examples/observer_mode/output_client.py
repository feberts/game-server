"""
Tic-tac-toe output client.

This program joins a game session as a passive observer. It can be used in
combination with the input client (but with a regular client, too). The input
client joins a session as an active player and submits moves. This way, the
implementation of input and output can be divided between two programs. Both
programs need to pass the same value for the name parameter when joining a game
session.
