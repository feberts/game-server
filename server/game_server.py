    Handling a connection.

    This function handles a single connection. It
    - receives data from the client
    - passes that data to the framework
    - sends the data returned by the framework back to the client
    - then closes the connection

    Data is expected to be received in JSON format and it is also sent back to
    the client in JSON format. The connection has a server side timeout and the
    amount of data accepted in a single request is limited by the server. The
    corresponding parameters are defined in the config module. Whenever
    possible, error messages are sent back to the client.

    Parameters:
    conn (socket): connection socket
    ip (str): client IP
    port (int): client port
